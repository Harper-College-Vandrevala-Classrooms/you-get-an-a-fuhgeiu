structure


criteria

    -Add a new student to the class (first name, last name, student ID)
    -Add a new assignment to the class (name of assignment, total points possible)
    -Give a student a grade for an assignment (the grade can be between zero and the total points possible)
    -Print out a formatted report that shows all of the students and all of the grade information


notes

    -Printing class and interface to pass in data classes per student
    
    - all data has student name associaiton
    
    
    
    
Data types

    Type class data

        - semi dynamically allocated contuguous memory block of type student data
    
    Type student data
        
        - semi dynamic allocated contugous memory block of type assignment data
       
    Type assignment data
    
        - assighnment name
        - score
 
 Main data structure
 
    Type T
    
    
    
    
Data ID structure

    store data with such tagged by and identifable by an ID, allows for more effecient acess and better orginization
    
    problem, if we want to acess a particular student data we need to iterate over entire student list and acess each class to get its name or id
    
    store id in a seprate container and, once we find the id than we can refernce the data object and acess its data
        
    contugous container block to utilize its simple itterator method
    
    takes in argument of a name (string literal) then assign ID, uses the first 4 letters not including whitespace than use ascii to get an id, and store in container
    
    in the same index store the student data object
    
    when acessig the index for id correspondes to index of container storing student data objects
    
    
    
    have container which stores a struct containing, the id and also the student data object.
    
    
        
    
interface

    adding data
    retriving data
    
    use an const object to make any changes to student data by the use of an interface
    
    read only interface which only holds const function types to read student data
    
    
process

    creating a class book
        
        -create class data object
    
    adding students data
    
        -create const object, then use it to assign it to student data, delete const object
    
    adding student grades
    
        -create const object, then use it to assign it to the grade data, delete object
    
    printing student grades
    
        -reads student data through const functions
